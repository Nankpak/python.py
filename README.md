This is how i spend my monthly allowance, 2000 Naira only.
i spend 400 naira on buying book.
i later found 100 naira on my pocket and i bought 250 naira snacks
i gave 25% of my current allowance to my siblings
and i used one-third of what is left for data then, i split the remaining 
balance equally for saving and tithing.
Finally i am left with 64 naira after removing all 100 naira note using the 
modulus assignment operator
